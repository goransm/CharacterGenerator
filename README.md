# A character generator for a roleplaying game

## Part 1
Define character types and sub types, and create a form to allow creating these character types.
When a new character is created, a summary is displayed in the form, and the character is appended
to a file named characters.txt, located in the \CharacterGenerator\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1 folder.

## Part 2
In addition to saving characters to a text file, they are also added to a database.

## Part 3
Created a Dbase class, with methods to interact with the database. Also added a view to list characters, as well as edit their names and delete selected characters.
